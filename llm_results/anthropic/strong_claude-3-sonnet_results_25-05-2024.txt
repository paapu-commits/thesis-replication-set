Test Case Name: File Manager Visible At Sidebar
Model used: anthropic/claude-3-sonnet
Model answer:
{
  "correct_locator": "//*[@id='sidebar']/div/div[1]/div/ul/li[7]/a/span",
  "solution_description": "The provided locator seems to be correct based on the information given. However, there might be an issue with the timing of the element being visible or the text being updated. Try adding a wait condition or increasing the timeout for the element to be visible and updatable before asserting the text. Alternatively, you could try a more relaxed locator strategy that doesn't rely on the exact text match, such as checking if the element contains the expected text."

Test Case Name: Navigation To Starter Page From Sidebar Is Functional
Model used: anthropic/claude-3-sonnet
Model answer:
{
  "correct_locator": "/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/aside[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/ul[1]/li[3]/a[1]",
  "solution_description": "Based on the provided list of potential locators and similarity scores, the most suitable locator for the 'Starter Page' link appears to be the XPath '/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/aside[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/ul[1]/li[3]/a[1]' with a similarity score of 96.13%. This locator targets the <a> tag within the third <li> element of the sidebar's unordered list, which matches the description of the 'Starter Page' link. To resolve the issue, replace the broken locator 'link:Starter Page' with this XPath locator in your Robot Framework test case."

Model answer:
{correct_locator: "select[name='scripts']", solution_description: "The correct locator for selecting the 'scripts' dropdown element seems to be `select[name='scripts']`.

Model used: anthropic/claude-3-sonnet
Model answer:
{
  "correct_locator": "/html[1]/body[1]/main[1]/div[1]/div[1]/form[1]/button[1]",
  "solution_description": "Based on the similarity scores, the most likely correct locator for the submit button is '/html[1]/body[1]/main[1]/div[1]/div[1]/form[1]/button[1]' with a similarity score of 95.64. This locator matches the element tag 'BUTTON' with the specified attributes. The original locator '//*[@type='submit']' was incorrect because it used an attribute value assignment syntax that is not valid in XPath."

Test Case Name: Dashboard Search Has Label Attached
Model used: anthropic/claude-3-sonnet
Model answer:
{
  "correct_locator": "//form//label[contains(@class,'search')]",
  "solution_description": "The error message indicates that the locator used ('class:sr-only') is not able to locate the element with the expected text 'Search'. Based on the similarity scores provided, it seems that the label element with the class 'search-only' has a high similarity score (90.21%) and is likely the intended target element. Therefore, the locator '//form//label[contains(@class,'search')]' should be used to locate the label element containing the text 'Search' within a form element."
