Test Case Name: Navigation To Starter Page From Sidebar Is Functional
Model used: meta-llama/llama-3-70b-instruct
Model answer:
{
correct_locator: xpath:///html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/aside[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/ul[1]/li[3]/a[1],
solution_description: "The robot framework test failed with the error 'Element 'link:Starter Page' did not appear in 5 seconds.' indicating that the element with the specified link text 'Starter Page' did not appear within the specified timeframe. Upon analyzing the potential locator candidates, the most suitable locator for the element is the xpath '/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/aside[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/ul[1]/li[3]/a[1]' which has a similarity ratio of 96.13%. This locator is recommended for the test."

Test Case Name: Tasks List Scripts Can Be Changed
Model used: meta-llama/llama-3-70b-instruct
Model answer:
{
correct_locator: name:scripts,
solution_description: "The correct locator for the element is 'name:scripts' because it matches the 'name' attribute of the SELECT element which is 'scripts'."
}

Explanation:
The initial error message indicated that the element with name 'script' was not found, but the actual element has a name attribute of 'scripts' (plural). The correct locator should use the correct attribute value.

Alternative solutions:
{
correct_locator: xpath://*[@name='scripts'],
solution_description: "The correct locator for the element is 'xpath://*[@name='scripts']' which uses an XPath expression to find the element with the 'name' attribute equal to 'scripts'."
}

{
correct_locator: css:select[name='scripts'],
solution_description: "The correct locator for the element is 'css:select[name='scripts']' which uses a CSS selector to find the SELECT element with the 'name' attribute equal to 'scripts'."
}

Model answer:
{
  correct_locator: xpath://*[@class='search-only'],

}
