Test Case Name: File Manager Visible At Sidebar
Model used: meta-llama/llama-3-8b-instruct
Model answer:
{
correct_locator: './/span[@class="ml-3"]',
solution_description: "The locator is changed to use the class 'ml-3' which is the same for all other SPANs, preventing the issue with the order of elements."
}

Note: The correct_locator/.//span[@class="ml-3"] is a more dynamic and reliable locator, which can handle the changes in the element order on the page, instead of relying on specific indices.
