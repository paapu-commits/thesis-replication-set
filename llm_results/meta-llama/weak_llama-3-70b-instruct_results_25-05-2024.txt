Test Case Name: File Manager Visible At Sidebar
Model used: meta-llama/llama-3-70b-instruct
Model answer:
{
correct_locator: "id:'sidebar'",
solution_description: "Using id selector directly is more efficient and less prone to errors than using complex XPath. 'PRO' was removed from the text as it's not present in the available locators"
}

Explanation: The suggested locator uses the id 'sidebar' which is a unique identifier of the element and it's generally more efficient and reliable than using complex XPath. Also, the text 'PRO' was removed from the locator as it's not present in the available locators, and it's better to use a more general locator that can be flexible to changes in the text content.

Test Case Name: Statistics Table Visible At Dashboard
Model used: meta-llama/llama-3-70b-instruct
Model answer:
{
correct_locator: "id:main-content",
solution_description: "Instead of using complex XPath, use id locator which is unique in the page"
}

{
correct_locator: "xpath://*[@id='main-content']//h3",
solution_description: "Modified the original XPath to make it more robust and flexible"
}

{
correct_locator: "xpath://main/div/div[1]/div[2]/h3",
solution_description: "Removed the dependency on id 'main-content' and used a relative XPath"
}

{
correct_locator: "css:#main-content > main > div > div:nth-child(1) > div:nth-child(2) > h3",
solution_description: "Converted the XPath to CSS selector which is more efficient and readable"
}

correct_locator: "xpath://h3[ancestor::*[@id='main-content']]",
solution_description: "Used an XPath axis to find the h3 element with an ancestor having id 'main-content'"
}

{
correct_locator: "xpath://div[contains(@class, 'some-class')]//h3",
solution_description: "Assuming 'some-class' is present in the div, used a more robust XPath using contains function"
}

{
correct_locator: "xpath://*//h3",
solution_description: "Used a very generic XPath which finds any h3 element in the page (not recommended)"
}

{
correct_locator: "xpath://main//h3",
solution_description: "Used a more generic XPath which finds any h3 element under main element"
}

{
correct_locator: "css:main > div > div:nth-child(1) > div:nth-child(2) > h3",
solution_description: "Removed the dependency on id 'main-content' and used a relative CSS selector"
}

correct_locator: "xpath://*[@id='main-content']/*//h3",

Test Case Name: All Apps Are Visible At Sidebar
Model used: meta-llama/llama-3-70b-instruct
Model answer:
{correct_locator: "id='dropdown-dashboard'", solution_description: "The original locator seems to be correct, the issue is likely with the expected text 'DataTables' not matching the actual text 'API' of the element. The id 'dropdown-dashboard' has the highest similarity ratio, and it's likely the correct element. Check the application's state and the expected text."}
