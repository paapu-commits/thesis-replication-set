Test Case Name: Navigation To Starter Page From Sidebar Is Functional

 {
"correct_locator": "",
"solution_description": "This error message indicates that a web element with a broken element locator was found in the tested web page. The locator ratios are provided in the error message and can be used to determine which of the 10 provided candidates is the correct one. To repair the failed test, you can either update the locator to match the correct element or provide a new locator that accurately identifies the element in question."

Test Case Name: Tasks List Scripts Can Be Changed
Model used: mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct
Model answer:
 Based on the provided information, it seems that the failed test is trying to locate an element named 'script' in the webpage, but the element was not found. The following is a list of 10 potential locator candidates that were retrieved from the tested webpage with a similarity ratio value:
```vbnet
{
    "tag": "SELECT",
    "class": "w-full py-1 px-2 mb-1 border border-gray-200 rounded dark:border-gray-600 dark:bg-gray-700 dark:text-white",
    "name": "scripts",
    "id": "",
    "value": "check-db-health.py"
}
```
This suggests that the broken element locator used was possibly the "SELECT" tag with the given class and name values.

However, based on the provided error message alone, it's hard to determine the exact cause of the issue without more context or information on the browser used. It's possible that the page may have undergone some changes or that there are other elements or scripts on the page that interfere with the locator.

In order to fix the issue, you may need to try adjusting the locator or using a different locator altogether depending on the specific changes made to the webpage. Additionally, you may want to check if there are any recent changes to the browser being used, as this can also affect element locators.

Test Case Name: All Apps Are Visible At Sidebar
Model used: mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct
Model answer:
{
  "correct_locator": "//*[@id='dropdown-dashboard']/li[1]/a",
  "solution_description": "The original locator was provided, but it appears the text content of the element has changed from 'DataTables' to 'API'. However, the structure of the HTML has not changed significantly. The provided candidates were similar in structure to the original locator, but with different attribute values, such as 'href' or 'textContent'. Since the original locator did not rely on these changing attribute values, it is still likely a valid locator. The issue might be a temporary one, so a retry of the test might resolve it. If the issue persists, updating the locator to reflect the new text content might be necessary."
