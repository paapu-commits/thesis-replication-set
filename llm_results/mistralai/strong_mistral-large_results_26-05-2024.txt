Test Case Name: File Manager Visible At Sidebar
Model used: mistralai/mistral-large
Model answer:
{
"correct_locator": "//*[@id='sidebar']/div/div[1]/div/ul/li[7]/a/span[contains(text(), 'File Manager')]",
"solution_description": "The error indicates that the text of the element was 'File Manager' instead of 'PRO File Manager'. To resolve this, I suggest updating the element locator to use a contains() function for the text. This will match elements that contain the specified text, even if there are additional characters or words."

Test Case Name: Theme Can Be Toggled To Dark Mode
Model used: mistralai/mistral-large
Model answer:
{
"correct_locator": "id:theme-toggler",
"solution_description": "The error message indicates that the element with id 'theme-toggle' did not appear in 5 seconds. However, the list of potential locator candidates shows that there is an element with id 'theme-toggler' which has a high similarity ratio of 95.93. This suggests that the id of the element might have been misspelled in the test script. Therefore, the id 'theme-toggler' should be used instead of 'theme-toggle'."

Test Case Name: Navigation To Starter Page From Sidebar Is Functional
Model used: mistralai/mistral-large
Model answer:
{
  "correct_locator": "xpath:/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/aside[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/ul[1]/li[3]/a[1]",
  "solution_description": "The error message indicates that the link 'Starter Page' could not be found within 5 seconds. The provided list of potential locator candidates shows a high similarity ratio for the first candidate with an xpath value of '/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/aside[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/ul[1]/li[3]/a[1]'. This locator can be used to identify the 'Starter Page' link and should resolve the issue."

Test Case Name: Tasks List Scripts Can Be Changed
Model used: mistralai/mistral-large
Model answer:
{
  "correct_locator": "name:scripts",
  "solution_description": "The error message indicates that the element with 'name:script' was not found. However, the list of potential locator candidates shows an element with 'name:scripts'. It seems there is a typo in the element locator used in the test script. The 'name' attribute value should be 'scripts' instead of 'script'."

Test Case Name: Navigation To Sign In Page Is Functional
Model used: mistralai/mistral-large
Model answer:
{
"correct_locator": "xpath=//button[@type='button']",
"solution_description": "The error message indicates that the element with type 'submit' was not found. However, the locator candidates show a button element with type 'button' which has a high similarity ratio of 95.64. Therefore, it's likely that the button's type attribute has been changed from 'submit' to 'button'. The suggested locator is to use xpath with the button's type attribute."

Test Case Name: Dashboard Search Has Label Attached
Model used: mistralai/mistral-large
Model answer:
{
"correct_locator": "xpath:/html[1]/body[1]/nav[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/form[1]/label[1]",
"solution_description": "The error message indicates that the element with class 'sr-only' does not have the expected text 'Search'. The provided list of potential locator candidates suggests that there is a 'label' element with a class 'search-only' which has a high similarity ratio of 90.21. This 'label' element is likely the one that should have the text 'Search'. Therefore, I suggest using the xpath of this 'label' element as the new locator."

Test Case Name: Statistics Table Visible At Dashboard
Model used: mistralai/mistral-large
Model answer:
{
"correct_locator": "//*[@id='main-content']/main[1]/div[1]/div[2]/h3[1]",
"solution_description": "The locator provided has a high similarity ratio of 87.86% with the first candidate. The difference is in the last div index. The provided locator uses div[2] while the candidate uses div[1]. This might be due to a dynamic element on the page. If the element is not found with the provided locator, it's recommended to use the suggested one."

Test Case Name: All Apps Are Visible At Sidebar
Model used: mistralai/mistral-large
Model answer:
{
  "correct_locator": "//*[@id='dropdown-dashboard']/li[2]/a[1]",
  "solution_description": "The error message indicates that the text of the element located by '//*[@id='dropdown-dashboard']/li[1]/a' should have been 'DataTables' but it was 'API'. This suggests that the wrong element is being selected. The provided candidate locators show that the one with the highest similarity ratio (93.65) has an index path of '//*[@id='dropdown-dashboard']/li[2]/a[1]'. This is likely the correct locator, as it points to the next li element in the list, which might contain the correct text 'DataTables'."
