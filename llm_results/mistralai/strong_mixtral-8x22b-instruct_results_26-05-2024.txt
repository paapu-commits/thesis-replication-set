Test Case Name: File Manager Visible At Sidebar
Model used: mistralai/mixtral-8x22b-instruct
Model answer:
 {
  "correct_locator": "//*[@id='sidebar']/div/div[1]/div/ul/li[7]/a/span",
  "solution_description": "The original locator seems to be correct based on the provided information, as it matches the 'idxpath' with the highest similarity ratio. However, the text of the element is 'File Manager' not 'PRO File Manager'. The issue might be due to the expected text not matching the actual text of the element. Please double-check the expected text and make sure it matches the actual text."

Test Case Name: Theme Can Be Toggled To Dark Mode
Model used: mistralai/mixtral-8x22b-instruct
Model answer:
 {
  "correct_locator": "id:theme-toggler",
  "solution_description": "The element's id that the test was attempting to locate was 'theme-toggle' which appears to be incorrect. According to the list of potential locator candidates, the closest matching element has an id of 'theme-toggler'. The error might have been caused by a simple typo in the locator specified in the test case. Changing the locator from 'id:theme-toggle' to 'id:theme-toggler' should resolve this issue."

Test Case Name: Navigation To Starter Page From Sidebar Is Functional
Model used: mistralai/mixtral-8x22b-instruct
Model answer:
{
  "correct_locator": "xpath=//a[contains(@href, '/start/')]",
  "solution_description": "Change the locator to a dynamic XPath that will locate the element based on its href attribute containing the text '/start/'. This will work regardless of changes in other attributes of the element as long as its href remains the same. This dynamic locator makes the test more stable in case the element under test changes over time or under different scenarios."

Test Case Name: Tasks List Scripts Can Be Changed
Model used: mistralai/mixtral-8x22b-instruct
Model answer:
 {
"correct_locator": "id: scripts",
"solution_description": "The provided locator 'name:script' is incorrect and does not match any element on the page. Based on the provided list of potential locator candidates, it seems that the 'SELECT' element with the 'name' attribute value 'scripts' is the intended target. Therefore, the corrected locator should be 'id: scripts'."

Test Case Name: Navigation To Sign In Page Is Functional
Model used: mistralai/mixtral-8x22b-instruct
Model answer:
 {"correct_locator": "'//button[@class='w-full px-5 py-3 text-base font-medium text-center text-white bg-primary-700 rounded-lg hover:bg-primary-800 focus:ring-4 focus:ring-primary-300 sm:w-auto dark:bg-primary-600 dark:hover:bg-primary-700 dark:focus:ring-primary-800']'", "solution_description": "The original locator was looking for an input element of type submit. However, based on the given list of potential elements, it seems that the button you are looking for is actually a 'button' element with a specific class. The provided locator updates the element type and uses the class attribute as the identifier."}
Test Case Name: Dashboard Search Has Label Attached
Model used: mistralai/mixtral-8x22b-instruct
Model answer:
{
  "correct_locator": "xpath:/html[1]/body[1]/nav[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/form[1]/label[1]",
  "solution_description": "The 'search-only' class label is a child of the 'form' tag, and it seems like the correct element you are looking for. The original locator 'class:sr-only' was not found or did not have the expected text 'Search'. Using the 'xpath' locator strategy to locate the label element directly will provide more accuracy and prevent potential failures due to changes in class names."

Test Case Name: Statistics Table Visible At Dashboard
Model used: mistralai/mixtral-8x22b-instruct
Model answer:
 {
  "correct_locator": "/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/main[1]/div[1]/div[2]/h3[1]",
  "solution_description": "Replace the broken locator with the one that has the highest similarity ratio. The suggested locator points to the same 'H3' tag but with a different, potentially more reliable, path. This locator also corresponds to the given xpath prefix in the original broken locator."
}
Test Case Name: All Apps Are Visible At Sidebar
Model used: mistralai/mixtral-8x22b-instruct
Model answer:
 {
  "correct_locator": "//*[@id='dropdown-dashboard']/li[1]/a",
  "solution_description": "Based on the provided similarity ratio values, the most similar locator to the broken one is '//*[@id='dropdown-dashboard']/li[1]/a'. This locator has a similarity ratio of 92.89% and appears to match the expected element with the text 'DataTables'. The broken locator seems to be targeting the wrong list element, as it is currently returning 'API' instead. By updating the locator to point to the first list element, we should be able to resolve the error."
