Test Case Name: File Manager Visible At Sidebar
Model used: mistralai/mistral-large
Model answer:
{
"correct_locator": "//*[@id='sidebar']/div/div[1]/div/ul/li[7]/a/span[contains(text(), 'File Manager')]",
"solution_description": "The issue is that the text of the element is not an exact match with 'PRO File Manager'. To resolve this, we can use the 'contains' function in the locator to check if the text contains 'File Manager' instead of the exact match."
}
Test Case Name: Theme Can Be Toggled To Dark Mode
Model used: mistralai/mistral-large
Model answer:
{
"correct_locator": "id='theme-toggler'",
"solution_description": "The error message indicates that the element with locator 'id:theme-toggle' did not appear within 5 seconds. However, the list of potential locator candidates shows a high similarity ratio for 'id='theme-toggler''. Therefore, replacing 'id:theme-toggle' with 'id='theme-toggler'' in the test script could resolve the issue."
}
Test Case Name: Navigation To Starter Page From Sidebar Is Functional
Model used: mistralai/mistral-large
Model answer:
{
"correct_locator": "link:href='#a'",
"solution_description": "The error message indicates that the link 'Starter Page' did not appear in 5 seconds. This could be due to a change in the webpage's HTML, causing the locator 'link:Starter Page' to break. The provided list of potential locator candidates shows 'link:href='#a'' as a potential replacement. This locator has a similarity ratio of 50.00, which is the highest among the candidates. Therefore, I suggest replacing 'link:Starter Page' with 'link:href='#a'' in the Robot Framework test script."
}
Test Case Name: Tasks List Scripts Can Be Changed
Model used: mistralai/mistral-large
Model answer:
{
"correct_locator": "<script",
"solution_description": "The error message indicates that the element locator 'name:script' failed to find the desired element. Looking at the list of potential locator candidates, the most suitable option seems to be '<script' with a similarity ratio of 66.67. This is because it directly references the script tag, which is likely what the test is looking for. The 'name' attribute may not be present or correct in the script tag, hence the failure of 'name:script'. Please try using '<script' as the new locator."
}
Test Case Name: Navigation To Sign In Page Is Functional
Model used: mistralai/mistral-large
Model answer:
{
"correct_locator": "//*[@type='button']",
"solution_description": "The error message indicates that the element with type='submit' was not found. The list of potential locator candidates suggests that the closest match is an element with type='button'. Therefore, replacing the broken locator with this new one should resolve the issue."
}
Test Case Name: Dashboard Search Has Label Attached
Model used: mistralai/mistral-large
Model answer:
{
"correct_locator": "class='sr-only'>Search</span>",
"solution_description": "The error message indicates that the text of the element with class 'sr-only' should have been 'Search' but it was ''. This suggests that the locator used is not unique or correct. From the list of potential locator candidates provided, 'class='sr-only'>Search</span>' seems to be the most suitable choice as it contains the expected text 'Search' within the element."
}
Test Case Name: Statistics Table Visible At Dashboard
Model used: mistralai/mistral-large
Model answer:
{
"correct_locator": "//h3[contains(text(), 'Statistics Table')]",
"solution_description": "The provided locator is absolute and brittle. Instead, we can use a relative locator that looks for an h3 tag containing the text 'Statistics Table'. This approach is more robust to changes in the page layout."
}
Test Case Name: All Apps Are Visible At Sidebar
Model used: mistralai/mistral-large
Model answer:
{
"correct_locator": "//*[@aria-controls='dropdown-dashboard']/li[1]/a",
"solution_description": "The error message indicates that the text of the element located by '//*[@id='dropdown-dashboard']/li[1]/a' was not 'DataTables' as expected, but 'API'. This suggests that the element locator may not be unique or correct. From the list of potential locator candidates, 'aria-controls' attribute has a high similarity ratio of 61.97 and may provide a more accurate element location. Therefore, I suggest replacing the current locator with '//*[@aria-controls='dropdown-dashboard']/li[1]/a'."
