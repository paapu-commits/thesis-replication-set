{
    "correct_locator": "//*[@id='sidebar']/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/ul[1]/li[7]/a[1]/span[1]",
    "solution_description": "The updated XPath locator is more specific and less likely to be affected by changes in the structure among preceding divs within the sidebar. This should maintain correct targeting of the 'PRO File Manager' element despite modifications to the page layout."
}

Model used: openai/gpt-4-turbo
Model answer:
{
    "correct_locator": "//*[@id='theme-toggler']",

Model used: openai/gpt-4-turbo
Model answer:
{
  "correct_locator": "xpath=/html[1]/body[1]/main[1]/div[1]/div[1]/form[1]/button[1]",
  "solution_description": "The most accurate locator candidate for the 'Submit' button was selected based on the highest similarity ratio, as well as the matching type attributes. The original test used a locator for type='submit', but the actual button on this form has type='button'. Instead, use the full XPath to reliably target this button."

  "solution_description": "The original locator 'class:sr-only' was incorrect as it targeted an element without any text. The correct locator is now updated to target the 'label' element directly associated with the search input, using its specific xpath. This label element contains the text 'Search', matching the test requirement."
