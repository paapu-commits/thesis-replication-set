Test Case Name: File Manager Visible At Sidebar
Model used: openai/gpt-4-turbo
Model answer:
{
  "correct_locator": "//*[@id='sidebar']/div/div[1]/div/ul/li[7]/a/span",
  "solution_description": "No change is required in the locator. It points accurately to the sidebar element where the 'File Manager' text is seen. Instead, check for updates or changes in the text content within the application. The expected text should be updated to 'File Manager' if the application now reflects this new text instead of 'PRO File Manager'."
}
Test Case Name: Theme Can Be Toggled To Dark Mode
Model used: openai/gpt-4-turbo
Model answer:
{
  "correct_locator": "id=theme-toggler",
  "solution_description": "Based on similarity scores, 'id=theme-toggler' closely matches the originally failed locator 'id:theme-toggle' with a similarity ratio of 84.85%. It is likely that the correct ID changed slightly, possibly during a recent update of the web page."
}
Test Case Name: Navigation To Starter Page From Sidebar Is Functional
Model used: openai/gpt-4-turbo
Model answer:
{
  "correct_locator": "link:href='#a'",
  "solution_description": "The most likely correct locator for the 'Starter Page' is 'link:href='#a'' as the original locator 'link:Starter Page' failed to find the element. This might be due to dynamic properties of the DOM or changes in the page structure. The suggested locator with a similarity rating of 50.00, which is one of the highest among the listed candidates, should be used to target the element effectively."
}
Test Case Name: Tasks List Scripts Can Be Changed
Model used: openai/gpt-4-turbo
Model answer:
{
  "correct_locator": "name='scripts'",
  "solution_description": "The original locator 'name:script' might be incorrect due to typographical error or ambiguity. After examining similar locators, the highly similar locator with the candidate 'name='scripts'' having a similarity ratio of 76.92 is selected as the most probable correct locator for the context of your test titled 'Tasks List Scripts Can Be Changed'. Adjust the locator in your Robot Framework script from 'name:script' to 'name='scripts'' to potentially resolve the issue."
}
Test Case Name: Navigation To Sign In Page Is Functional
Model used: openai/gpt-4-turbo
Model answer:
{
  "correct_locator": "//*[@type='button']",
  "solution_description": "The test failed due to a non-existent submit button element type. Analyzing the available elements, a button element with type 'button' has the highest similarity score. It's possible that the intended function for submission is being performed by a button element instead of a traditional 'submit' input."
}
Test Case Name: Dashboard Search Has Label Attached
Model used: openai/gpt-4-turbo
Model answer:
{
  "correct_locator": "class='sr-only'>Search</label>",
  "solution_description": "The locator 'class=sr-only' was too generic and matched multiple elements without the specific text 'Search'. Updating the locator to specifically target the label element which includes the text 'Search' should solve the problem."
}
Test Case Name: Statistics Table Visible At Dashboard
Model used: openai/gpt-4-turbo
Model answer:
{
  "correct_locator": "id=main-content",
  "solution_description": "Since the specific XPath locator failed to find the h3 element, switching to a more robust locator by using the 'id' of the main container could be effective. This can help avoid problems caused by changes in the DOM structure affecting the deeper nested elements. Once the main container is reliably located, the specifications inside it should be manually checked to find the precise element."
}
Test Case Name: All Apps Are Visible At Sidebar
Model used: openai/gpt-4-turbo
Model answer:
{
  "correct_locator": "//*[@id='apps-dropdown']/li[1]/a",
  "solution_description": "The tested element's locator appears to be incorrect as it refers to a different dropdown. Given the similarity of dropdown ID names and their purposes, corrected to 'apps-dropdown' which seems to be more relevant for 'DataTables'. This path targets the first item in the corrected dropdown list."
